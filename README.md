(In-Progress)

A local web-based application that takes in a .csv from Canvas gradebook and a .xlsx file from DeltaMath gradebook. The application will then clean the data and update any corresponding homework scores. Finally it will output a new .csv file to upload to canvas for gradebook updates. This is a project that I am currently working on to make grading more automatic for me for students in Algebra 2 and Financial Algebra.
